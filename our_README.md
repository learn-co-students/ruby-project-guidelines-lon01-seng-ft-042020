# Module One Final Project 
# Background 
There's been a theft at Flatiron School and it's down to you to figure out who the culprit is. 
Your handy CSI CLI will direct you through a narrative, dropping a series of clues to guide your investigations. 
# Instructions
To start playing, you will need to fork and clone this repo, or download it as a zip file.
You will then need to install the relevant gems, you can do this by running "bundle install" in your terminal. 
Once you're ready, you can open a terminal, and type in the command: 
    # ruby bin/run.rb 
(This is a command that will run the contents of the game for you.) 
Now, from the command line you have access to a series of methods which allow you to find out certain traits of your suspects, for e.g.: 
            - Age
            - Gender 
            - Location 
            - Hair color 
            - Multilingual?
            - Avid drinker?
            - A fact about them 
            - Into tech?
To figure out who the culprit is, you will need to filter through your suspect list using the methods available to you from the CSI CLI. 
Once you pick a method, your app will return you a list of suspects who match the criteria which you have specified. 
It is then your job to cross check this list with the suspect list displayed to you, and remove suspects accordingly. 
You'll want to read the storyline carefully and use your powers of deduction to guide you through. 
You can use multiple filters in one turn, or you can delete multiple suspects in one turn - but be careful: once you delete a suspect, you may well have let them escape!
There are no real ways to check the solution for this game, it is up to you to be meticulous in your handling of suspects. 
But at the end, we will be sure to reveal the identity of the true culprit. 
Good luck, Detective! This is all you now.
